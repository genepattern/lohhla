Based on the manifest file, here's a suggested paramgroups.json:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Required Inputs",
        "description": "Input files required for LOH HLA analysis",
        "hidden": false,
        "parameters": [
            "bamList",
            "hlaList"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "Optional Parameters",
        "description": "Additional configuration options for the analysis",
        "hidden": false,
        "parameters": [
            "outputDir"
        ]
    }
]
```

Reasoning:
1. "bamList" and "hlaList" are both required input files (no optional flag), so they are placed in the "Required Inputs" group.
2. "outputDir" is marked as optional (p3_optional=on), so it goes into the "Optional Parameters" group.
3. The group names and descriptions are descriptive of the module's purpose and parameter types.
4. Both groups are set to not be hidden, allowing users to see all parameters.

The JSON follows the structure of the previous example, with clear grouping of parameters based on their requirement and role in the analysis.
